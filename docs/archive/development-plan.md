# nVDB Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the incremental development of nVDB, from core storage primitives to a complete vector database. Each phase builds on the previous, with working code at every milestone.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation — Storage Primitives

**Goal**: Persistent, memory-mapped storage with crash safety using LSM-Lite architecture.

### Phase 1A: File Format, Mmap & Validation

**Deliverables:**

1. **Segment file format**
   - 64-byte header: magic, version, dimension, offsets, checksum
   - Body: Vector Region (packed f32s, 64-byte aligned) → ID Mapping → Payload Region
   - rkyv zero-copy layout for all regions

2. **Memory-mapped segments**
   - Immutable, read-only mmap via `memmap2`
   - Zero-copy deserialization via `rkyv`
   - Checksum verification on open; skip deep validation if matches
   - File size check before mmap exposure

3. **Internal ID mapping**
   - `BiMap<String, u32>` for ID translation
   - Dense integer IDs for HNSW efficiency

4. **Multi-process safety**
   - `flock` exclusive lock on writer open
   - `Error::CollectionLocked` if another writer exists

**Success Criteria:**
- Create segment, write documents, close, reopen — data intact via mmap
- Checksum verification passes; corruption detected and rejected
- Two processes cannot open same collection as writers simultaneously

### Phase 1B: WAL, Memtable & Recovery

**Deliverables:**

1. **Write-ahead log (WAL)**
   - Record format: `[seq:u64][len:u32][crc32:u32][opcode:u8][body]`
   - Monotonic sequence numbers per collection
   - Truncate partial/corrupt tail on replay; forward-skip if possible

2. **Collection manifest**
   - Tracks active segments, last WAL sequence, configuration
   - Atomic updates via write-to-temp + fsync + rename

3. **Memtable**
   - `HashMap<u32, Document>` for O(1) lookups
   - Parallel `Vec<f32>` in SoA layout for SIMD-friendly scans
   - Delete bitmap in-memory only, reconstructed from WAL

4. **Memtable flush (memtable → segment)**
   - Converts the in-memory memtable into an immutable on-disk segment
   - Trigger: WAL size exceeds threshold (e.g., 64MB) or explicit `flush()` call
   - Process:
     1. Freeze current memtable (stop accepting writes into it)
     2. Create new empty memtable + new WAL for incoming writes
     3. Write frozen memtable to new segment file (`*.tmp`, then atomic rename)
     4. Update manifest with new segment and new WAL start sequence
     5. Delete old WAL
   - Readers see old memtable until new segment is visible via `ArcSwap`
   - Without flush, memtable grows unbounded and WAL replay gets slower on every restart

5. **Basic API**
   ```rust
   let db = Database::open(path)?;
   let coll = db.create_collection("test", CollectionConfig { 
       dim: 768,
       durability: Durability::FdatasyncEachBatch,
   })?;
   coll.insert(doc)?;
   coll.insert_batch(docs)?;  // Single WAL entry, bounded size (64MB)
   coll.get(id)?;
   coll.flush()?; // freeze memtable → write to segment → start fresh
   coll.sync()?;  // explicit fsync
   ```

6. **SIGBUS mitigation**
   - `madvise(MADV_POPULATE_READ)` on segment open
   - Document storage reliability assumption

**Success Criteria:**
- Insert → crash (simulated) → reopen → data recovered
- WAL replay is idempotent (N replays yield identical state)
- Partial WAL tail handled gracefully (truncate or skip)
- `insert_batch` significantly faster than N× `insert`
- Crash between WAL append and sync behaves per durability mode
- Flush produces valid segment; data queryable from segment after flush
- WAL size bounded by flush threshold; restart replay time bounded accordingly

---

## Phase 2: Search — Exact Similarity

**Goal**: Brute-force vector search with SIMD acceleration.

### Deliverables

1. **SIMD distance functions** (using `wide` crate)
   - Dot product, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance
   - Aligned loads (vectors are 64-byte aligned in segment)
   - Runtime CPU feature detection

2. **Exact search implementation**
   - Linear scan over memtable (SoA) + all segments
   - Top-k selection: binary heap for large k, partial selection for small k
   - Deterministic tie-break: score, then internal ID
   - `madvise(MADV_SEQUENTIAL)` before scan

3. **Benchmark protocol**
   - Hardware profile: CPU model, RAM, storage type
   - Dataset: dimension, count, distribution, normalization
   - Conditions: warm/cold cache, thread count
   - Metrics: p50/p95/p99 latency, CPU cycles/query
   - Benchmark AoS vs SoA layout

**API Addition:**
```rust
pub enum Distance {
    DotProduct,
    Cosine,
    Euclidean,
}

let results = coll.search(Search::new(&query_vec)
    .top_k(10)
    .distance(Distance::Cosine))?;
```

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% recall (by definition)
- SIMD shows measurable speedup over scalar
- p99 <1ms for 100K × 768 vectors on desktop CPU (warm cache)
- Scalar vs SIMD parity (same results, within floating-point tolerance)
- Layout decision (AoS vs SoA) justified by benchmark data

---

## Phase 3: Index — HNSW for Approximate Search

**Goal**: Hierarchical Navigable Small World index for sub-linear search.

### Deliverables

1. **HNSW implementation**
   - Multi-layer graph with parameters: `M`, `ef_construction`, `ef_search`
   - Internal u32 IDs only (no strings in graph)
   - CSR-style flat layout: `Vec<u32>` with offset table
   - Prefetch next candidate's neighbors during traversal

2. **Deletion strategy**
   - Soft delete: WAL entry + bitmap mark, skip during search
   - Graph retains tombstoned nodes
   - Rebuild trigger: >20% tombstoned nodes

3. **Index persistence**
   - Serialize to `index.hnsw` using rkyv
   - CSR layout enables zero-copy loading
   - Auto-rebuild from vectors if missing/corrupt

4. **Hybrid search**
   - HNSW retrieval (top-100) → exact re-ranking (top-k)
   - Post-filtering for metadata predicates
   - `madvise(MADV_RANDOM)` on vector region during search

5. **Fallback path**
   - Exact search if index missing or disabled
   - Documented latency expectations for fallback

**API Addition:**
```rust
let results = coll.search(Search::new(&query_vec)
    .top_k(10)
    .approximate(true)
    .ef(100))?;
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Recall@10 >95% on standard benchmark (GLOVE)
- Query latency <10ms for 10M vectors
- Index size <1.5× raw vector size
- CSR layout shows 20-40% improvement over pointer-based graph
- Graceful fallback to exact search

---

## Phase 4: Query Interface — Mongo-Like API

**Goal**: Ergonomic API with filtering and builder pattern.

### Deliverables

1. **Type-safe Filter DSL**
   ```rust
   coll.search(Search::new(&query_vec)
       .filter(Filter::and([
           Filter::eq("category", "books"),
           Filter::gt("year", 2020),
       ])))
   ```

2. **Supported predicates**
   - Equality, comparison ($gt, $gte, $lt, $lte)
   - Logical ($and, $or)
   - Array operators ($in) — optional

3. **Filter execution**
   - Post-filtering: Search vectors, then filter results
   - Document limitation: may return fewer than k if filter is selective
   - Track metric: fraction of candidates discarded by filter

**Success Criteria:**
- All Phase 2/3 functionality accessible via new API
- Filter evaluation doesn't dominate query time for typical predicates
- JSON macro convenience layer available but not required

---

## Phase 5: Maintenance — Compaction

**Goal**: Reclaim space from deleted documents and rebuild index.

### Deliverables

1. **Manifest-based compaction protocol**
   - Read manifest for active segments
   - Merge segments, remove deleted docs, rebuild HNSW
   - Write new segment(s) to `*.tmp`
   - Write new manifest (atomic rename)
   - Delete old segments

2. **Crash safety**
   - Orphan temp files ignored on startup
   - Old segments valid via old manifest if compaction interrupted
   - Compaction idempotent (safe to retry)

3. **Synchronous operation**
   - `compact()` blocks until complete (v1.0)
   - Progress tracking for future resumable compaction

4. **Statistics**
   ```rust
   let info = coll.info()?;
   // doc_count, deleted_count, deleted_ratio, segment_count, index_size
   ```

**Success Criteria:**
- 50% deletes → compaction halves file size
- Query performance maintained or improved post-compaction
- Crash at any point during compaction recoverable without data loss
- Orphan files cleaned up automatically on startup

---

## Phase 6: Hardening — Testing & Documentation

**Goal**: Production readiness.

### Deliverables

1. **Test coverage**
   - Unit tests for all public APIs
   - Property-based tests (`proptest`) for WAL invariants
   - Crash recovery tests (simulated power loss at various points)
   - Concurrency stress tests (many readers, single writer)
   - Fuzz testing for WAL parser and file format

2. **Required property suites**
   - WAL parser never panics on arbitrary bytes
   - Replay idempotency: N replays yield identical state
   - Segment validator soundness

3. **Benchmarks** (using `criterion`)
   - Insertion throughput (docs/sec, batch vs single)
   - Query latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99, warm vs cold)
   - Recall vs speed trade-off curves
   - Recovery time vs WAL size and segment count
   - Comparison with `hnswlib`, `usearch`

4. **Observability**
   - Track open-time components: directory scan, validation, WAL replay, index load
   - Regression guardrails for recovery time

5. **Documentation**
   - API docs (rustdoc with examples)
   - User guide (quickstart, durability modes, best practices)
   - Architecture decision records (ADRs)

### Success Criteria
- 90%+ test coverage
- Fuzz testing passes (WAL, file format)
- Benchmarks prove competitive performance
- Recovery time bounded and measured
- Documentation sufficient for new user adoption

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Error Handling

All errors are explicit (`Result<T, Error>`). No panics in library code.

```rust
pub enum Error {
    Io { source: std::io::Error, context: String },
    Corruption { file: PathBuf, offset: u64, message: String },
    InvalidArgument { field: String, reason: String },
    NotFound { id: String },
    WrongDimension { expected: usize, got: usize },
    CollectionLocked { name: String },
}
```

Use `thiserror` for boilerplate reduction.

### Concurrency Model

| Component | Access Pattern | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Segments | Immutable, lock-free | mmap + Arc |
| Segment list | Atomic updates | `ArcSwap<Vec<Arc<Segment>>>` |
| Memtable | Read-heavy, write-exclusive | `RwLock<HashMap>` + SoA buffer |
| WAL | Append-only, single writer | `Mutex<File>` |
| Manifest | Atomic replace only | Write-temp + rename |

**Invariants:**
- Single writer per collection (enforced by `flock`)
- Readers never block (immutable segments)
- Writers don't block readers (copy memtable, swap Arc)

### SIMD Strategy

| Tier | Implementation | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | `wide` crate (portable) | Primary, stable Rust |
| 2 | Platform intrinsics | Optional, AVX-512 |
| 3 | Scalar fallback | Always available |

**Alignment requirements:**
- Segment header: 64 bytes
- Vector region offset: 64-byte aligned
- All common dimensions (384, 768, 1536) naturally 64-byte aligned

### Memory Allocation

```toml
[dependencies]
mimalloc = { version = "0.1", optional = true }
```

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "mimalloc")]
#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: mimalloc::MiMalloc = mimalloc::MiMalloc;
```

Benchmark with/without to quantify impact.

### Crate Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
memmap2 = "0.9"
rkyv = { version = "0.7", features = ["validation"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
arc-swap = "1.6"
wide = "0.7"
thiserror = "1.0"
crc32fast = "1.3"
parking_lot = "0.12"
blake3 = "1.5"
mimalloc = { version = "0.1", optional = true }

[dev-dependencies]
criterion = "0.5"
proptest = "1.4"
```
